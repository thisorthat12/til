data-cleaner: refactored adapter and task into a generic one (Robbe). Dataprocessor has method taking consumers. Specific adapters call dataprocessor with their specific mapper and repository methods. For tasks, use same lambda principle.

batch metrics: got it merged into beta by Kris. For prod, Glenn had some changes so he approved it. Not yet merged.

JV needed some help with checking if data cleaner worked. In dev, truncated table, ran the job on argo and saw that the defined limit of rows was now present in table.
